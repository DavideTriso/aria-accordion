```html
<!-- WIDGET BEGIN / GROUP OF ACCORDIONS -->
<section class="accordion-group" id="accordion-group-1">

    <!-- ACCORDION BEGIN -->
    <div class="accordion-group__accordion">
      <header class="accordion-group__accordion-head">
        <h3 class="accordion-group__accordion-heading"><button type="button" class="accordion-group__accordion-btn">Accordion 1 <span>Expand/Close</span></button></h3>
      </header>
      <div class="accordion-group__accordion-collapse">
        <div class="accordion-group__accordion-content">
          <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
          specimen book.</p>
          <button type="button">Test focus</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- ACCORDION END -->
    
    
    <!-- ACCORDION BEGIN -->
    <div class="accordion-group__accordion">
      <header class="accordion-group__accordion-head">
        <h3 class="accordion-group__accordion-heading"><button type="button" class="accordion-group__accordion-btn">Accordion 1 <span>Expand/Close</span></button></h3>
      </header>
      <div class="accordion-group__accordion-collapse">
        <div class="accordion-group__accordion-content">
          <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
          Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
          specimen book.</p>
          <button type="button">Test focus</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- ACCORDION END -->
    
  </section>
```

### JS: Initialise

Use following code to initalise the widget:

```javascript
$('.accordion-group').ariaAccordion({
  option1: value1,
  option2: value2
});
```

## Methods:

The plugin supports following methods: expand, show, collapse, hide and trigger.

### Expand and open

The method **expand** expands an accordion by sliding-down the accordion collapsible region.

````javascript
$('#accordion-id').ariaAccordion('expand');
````

The method **show** leads to th same results as **expand**, but without applying any animation.

````javascript
$('#accordion-id').ariaAccordion('open');
````

### Collapse and hide

The method **collapse** collapses an accordion by sliding-up the accordion collapsible region.

````javascript
$('#accordion-id').ariaAccordion('collapse');
````

The method **hide** leads to the same results as **collapse**, but without applying any animation.

````javascript
$('#accordion-id').ariaAccordion('hide');
````


### Trigger

**Trigger** expands or collapses an accordion based on the state of the accordion.

````javascript
$('#accordion-id').ariaAccordion('trigger');
````

**NOTE:** All the methods can be called both on a single accordion element, or on a set of elements.
